\title{Estimation of the shape of the neighborhood of points}
\usage{
lasdetectshape(las, shape, th, attribute, k = 8, filter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{an object of class LAS}

\item{shape}{character. One of "plane", "h-plane","line",
"colinear2". See details.}

\item{th}{numeric. The thresholds values used in labelling criterion (see details). User must
provide a vector with the good number of values depending on the method used.}

\item{attribute}{character. The name of the new column to add into the LAS object. If missing a
default name is used.}

\item{k}{interger. The number of k-nearest neighbors.}

\item{filter}{formula of logical predicates. Enable to run the function only on points of interest
in an optimized way. See also examples.}
}
\value{
A LAS object with a new column names \code{Coplanar}, \code{Hcoplanar} or \code{Colinear} that indicates
those points that are part of a neighborhood that is approximately coplanar/colinear (TRUE) or not
(FALSE).
}
\description{
For each point, computes the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the neighbouring points. The
points that meet a given criterion based on the eigenvalue are labeled as approximately coplanar/colinear
or any other shape supported by the function (see details).
}
\details{
In the following \eqn{a1, a2, a3} denote the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the neighbouring
points in ascending order. \eqn{th1, th2, th3} denote a set of threshold values. Points are labelled
\code{TRUE} if they meet the following criteria. \code{FALSE} otherwise.\cr
\describe{
\item{plane}{Detection of plans based on criteria defined by Limberger & Oliveira (2015) (see references).
A points is labelled as approximately coplanar if: \deqn{a2 > (th1*a1) and (th2*a2) > a3} It expects
two threshold values. \code{th = c(25,6) is a good start.}}
\item{h-plane}{The same than 'plane' but with an extra test on the orientation of the Z vector
of the principal components to test the horizontality of the surface.  \deqn{a2 > (th1*a1) and (th2*a2) > a3 and |Z| > th3 }
|Z| should be exactly equal to 1 in theory. In practice 0.98 or 0.99 should be good. \code{th = c(25,6,0.98) is a good start.}}
\item{line}{Detection of lines inspired by Limberger & Oliveira (2015) criterion. A points is
labelled as approximately colinear if: \deqn{th1*a2 < a3 and th1*a1 < a3}
It expect one threshold value. \code{th = 10} is a good start.}
